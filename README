# dns.c

Standalone program used to sniff dns query packets (udp port 53) and outputs the user's dns query's name field.

DNS label output code borrowed from here: https://github.com/thentenaar/simple-dns-sniffer


# ip_sniffer.c
Standalone program used to sniff IP packets and outputs the ip-address and attempts to do a reverse dns lookup to output the user friendly version of the ip address.

This website was very instrumental in helping me understand using libpcap library and implementing both of these programs:
